# generic-multipurpose-server
Despite the name being quite pretentious the thing itself ain't planned to be much. The idea is to basically dump a bunch of adapters/interfaces for different kinds of connections and wire them up using channels. Eventually should lead to some sort of a swiss-knife server that can be used in various configurations for various needs.
